> [!NOTE]
> This repository is derived from the upstream Microsoft `content-processing-solution-accelerator` sample and was then heavily modified into a journey-driven claims demo. Most of the changes live in the new `ContentProcessorClaimsDemo` SPA and the workflow's RAI safety stage; the underlying content-processing engine still derives from that original codebase. The MIT `LICENSE` retains Microsoft's original copyright on the upstream portions. This repository is shared in a **personal / independent capacity** and is **not** an official Microsoft product, accelerator, or supported release, nor is it produced or endorsed by Microsoft or any other organisation.

Process multi-document claims by extracting data from each document, applying schemas with confidence scoring, and generating AI-powered summaries and gap analysis across the entire claim. Upload multiple files — invoices, forms, images, contracts — to a single claim, and the solution automatically processes each document through a multi-modal content extraction pipeline, then orchestrates cross-document summarization and gap identification using an Agent Framework Workflow Engine.

The core content processing engine supports text, images, tables and graphs with schema-based transformation and confidence scoring. These capabilities can be applied to numerous use cases including: insurance claims processing, contract review, invoice processing, ID verification, and logistics shipment record processing.

## Solution overview

This solution leverages Azure AI Foundry, Azure AI Content Understanding Service, Azure OpenAI Service GPT-5.1, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Cosmos DB, and Azure Container Apps to process multi-document claims through a two-level architecture:

- **Claim Processing Workflow** — Upload multiple documents to a claim via the Web UI. The Content Process Workflow (built on the Agent Framework Workflow Engine) orchestrates document extraction, AI-powered summarization, and gap analysis across all documents in the claim.
- **Content Processing Pipeline** — The core engine (carried forward from v1) that processes each individual document through a 4-stage pipeline: Extract → Map → Evaluate → Save, with confidence scoring for extraction accuracy and schema mapping.

Processing, extraction, schema transformation, summarization, and gap analysis steps are tracked with status and scored for accuracy to automate processing and identify as-needed human validation.

### Agentic architecture

The claim processing workflow is built on the **Agent Framework's Workflow Engine** — a DAG-based event-streaming execution model that orchestrates specialized AI agents across the claim lifecycle. Each stage is an autonomous `Executor` that receives context, performs its task, and passes results downstream.

## Features

### Key features

<details open>

<summary>Click to learn more about the key features this solution enables</summary>

- **Multi-document claim processing**  
  Upload multiple files to a single claim and process them as a batch. The claim workflow orchestrates content extraction for each document, then performs cross-document summarization and gap analysis.

- **Multi-modal content processing**  
  Core extraction uses Azure AI Content Understanding `prebuilt-layout`, linked analyzers, and schema-driven field extraction for PDFs and images. Foundry vision is used as a classification safety net when Content Understanding cannot confidently route a file.

- **AI-powered summarization & gap analysis**  
  After all documents in a claim are processed, GPT-5.1 generates a consolidated summary and performs gap analysis — detecting missing documents and flagging cross-document discrepancies across the claim.

- **No-code gap analysis ruleset (YAML DSL)**  
  Gap analysis rules are defined in a reusable YAML-based Domain-Specific Language — domain experts can add, modify, or replace rules without writing code. The same DSL format is portable across industries (insurance, logistics, legal, finance). See [Gap Analysis Ruleset Guide](./docs/GapAnalysisRulesetGuide.md).

- **Agent Framework Workflow Engine**  
  Claim processing is orchestrated by a DAG-based workflow engine with event streaming, concurrent workers, retry logic, and dead-letter queue support for production reliability.

- **Schema-based data transformation**  
  Maps extracted content to custom or industry-defined schemas and outputs as JSON for interoperability.

- **Confidence scoring**  
  Calculation of entity extraction and schema mapping processes for accuracy, providing scores to drive manual human-in-the-loop review, if desired.

- **Review, validate, update**  
  Transparency in reviewing processing steps, summaries, and gap analysis — allowing for review, comparison to source asset, ability to modify output results, and annotation for historical reference.

- **API driven processing pipelines**  
  API endpoints are available for claim lifecycle management, content processing, schema management, and external source system integration.

## Business scenario

The included sample scenario demonstrates a **First Notice of Loss (FNOL)** workflow for an auto insurance company. A claims analyst receives incoming collision claims — each containing an auto insurance claim form, police report, repair estimate, and photos of vehicle damage — that need to be processed together.

The analyst creates a claim in the system and uploads all documents. The workflow engine automatically:

1. **Extracts** structured data from each document — policyholder info, vehicle details (VIN, plate), incident description, and repair line items — using Azure AI Content Understanding linked analyzers and `prebuilt-layout` output.
2. **Summarizes** findings across the entire claim — producing a consolidated report covering claimant details, vehicle info, incident narrative, damage assessment, and estimated costs.
3. **Runs gap & discrepancy analysis** using YAML DSL rules — detecting missing documents (e.g., no police report for a theft claim, no repair estimate when the loss exceeds $2,000) and flagging cross-document discrepancies (e.g., mismatched claim numbers, VIN conflicts between the claim form and police report, or date-of-loss differences).

The analyst reviews the AI-generated summary for a quick overview, checks gap analysis results for flagged issues and discrepancies, and drills into individual document extractions when needed. What previously required hours of manual cross-referencing is now orchestrated in minutes.

> **Sample data included:** Four synthetic claim packs ship under `src/ContentProcessorAPI/samples/`: `claim_demo_persona/` (the canonical multi-document demo persona), `claim_collision_commercial_hint/` (personal-use policy with subtle TNC/ride-share usage cues — exercises gap analysis), `claim_hail_storm/` (comprehensive weather loss with multi-photo damage), and `claim_theft_vandalism/` (recovered-after-theft, non-collision). See [Golden Path Workflows](./docs/GoldenPathWorkflows.md) for a step-by-step walkthrough.

⚠️ The sample data used in this repository is synthetic and generated using Azure OpenAI service. The data is intended for use as sample data only.

### Business value

<details>

<summary>Click to learn more about what value this solution provides</summary>

- **Automated claim intake**  
  Upload claim forms, police reports, repair estimates, and damage photos to a single claim. The workflow engine orchestrates extraction, summarization, and gap analysis automatically — reducing intake processing from hours to minutes.

- **Cross-document intelligence**  
  AI-powered summarization consolidates findings across all documents in a claim, while gap analysis identifies missing documents and flags discrepancies — such as mismatched claim numbers, VIN conflicts, or date-of-loss differences between the claim form and police report.

- **No-code gap rules**  
  Gap analysis rules are defined in a YAML DSL that domain experts can modify without writing code — add required document checks, adjust severity levels, or define new discrepancy rules across industries.

- **Confidence-driven human-in-the-loop**  
  Extraction and schema mapping are scored for accuracy using dual confidence signals (OCR-level and model log-probability), so analysts can focus human review on low-confidence results while high-confidence data flows through automatically.

- **Verifiable review & audit trail**  
  Review AI-generated extractions, summaries, and gap analysis results side-by-side with source documents. Annotate changes, add comments, and compare processing steps for transparency and audit readiness.

- **Responsible AI safety gate**  
  A built-in RAI executor screens every document's extracted content against 10 safety categories — including self-harm, violence, prompt injection, and discriminatory content — before further processing, helping ensure only safe content reaches downstream workflows.

- **Schema-driven extensibility**  
  Define custom Pydantic schemas to extract structured data from any document type. The same extraction pipeline generalizes across industries — insurance, logistics, legal, finance — without code changes.

- **Production-ready orchestration**  
  The Agent Framework Workflow Engine provides DAG-based execution with event streaming, retry logic, dead-letter queues, and graceful shutdown — designed for reliable, scalable processing in production environments.

- **API-first integration**  
  All capabilities — claim lifecycle, content processing, schema management — are exposed through REST APIs, enabling integration with existing line-of-business systems, RPA workflows, and custom applications.
