"""
Domain models for the claim-processing workflow.

These Pydantic models are persisted as JSON documents in Cosmos DB
(MongoDB API) by ``Claim_Processes`` and flow through every pipeline
stage — document ingestion, summarisation, and gap analysis.

Classes:
    Claim_Steps
        Enum of the high-level workflow stages a claim passes through.
    Content_Process
        Per-document processing result (file name, scores, status).
    Claim_Process
        Root aggregate that tracks the full lifecycle of a single
        claim batch, including its list of ``Content_Process`` entries.
