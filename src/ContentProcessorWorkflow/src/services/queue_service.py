"""Queue-based Claim Processing Service.

This module implements a background queue worker that consumes claim batch
processing requests from an Azure Storage Queue and executes the step-based
workflow runner in ``src/steps/claim_processor.py``.

Architecture
------------
- **Entry point**: ``main_service.py`` creates a ``ClaimProcessingQueueService``
  instance and calls ``start_service()``, which spawns one or more async
  worker loops.
- **Worker loop** (``_worker_loop``): each worker long-polls the queue for a
  single message at a time, wraps the processing in an ``asyncio.Task``, and
  awaits it.
- **Message processing** (``_process_queue_message``): parses the JSON payload
  to extract ``claim_process_id``, starts a visibility-timeout renewal loop,
  then delegates to ``ClaimProcessor.run()``.
- **Visibility renewal** (``_renew_visibility_loop``): runs concurrently with
  the job and re-extends the visibility timeout at ~60 % intervals so long-
  running jobs don't become visible to other consumers.

Message lifecycle
-----------------
1. Message is dequeued with ``visibility_timeout_minutes`` (default 30 min).
2. On **success**: the message is deleted from the queue.
3. On **failure** (attempt < ``max_receive_attempts``): the visibility timeout
   is shortened to ``retry_visibility_delay_seconds`` so the message becomes
   available again quickly.
4. On **final failure** (attempt >= ``max_receive_attempts``):
   a. A JSON payload containing the original content and failure reason is
      sent to the dead-letter queue.
   b. Output blobs under ``<claim_process_id>/converted/`` are deleted.
   c. The original message is deleted from the main queue.
   d. If the dead-letter send fails, the original message is kept (visibility
      is extended) to avoid silent data loss.
5. Malformed messages (invalid JSON, missing ``claim_process_id``) are
   immediately dead-lettered regardless of attempt count.

    Polls an Azure Storage Queue, dispatches each message to the step-based
    workflow runner (``ClaimProcessor``), and manages visibility-timeout
    renewal to prevent duplicate processing.

    Concurrency model:
        ``start_service()`` spawns ``concurrent_workers`` async tasks, each
        running ``_worker_loop()``.  Within a worker, each message is
        processed by a separate child ``asyncio.Task`` so that
        ``stop_process()`` can cancel a single job without tearing down the
        worker loop.

    Instance tracking:
        A class-level ``_instance_count`` / ``_active_instances`` set is
        maintained so that ``stop_service()`` can detect and prevent ghost
        processes when a new instance replaces an old one.

    In-flight tracking dictionaries (keyed by ``worker_id``):
        - ``_worker_inflight``: current ``process_id`` (observability).
        - ``_worker_inflight_message``: ``(message_id, pop_receipt)`` so the
          message can be deleted or its visibility updated at any time.
        - ``_worker_inflight_batch_id``: ``claim_process_id`` used for blob
          cleanup on failure.
        - ``_worker_inflight_task``: the child ``asyncio.Task`` running the
          job, allowing targeted cancellation.

    Retry + dead-letter policy:
        - Failed messages are retried up to ``max_receive_attempts``
          (Azure's ``dequeue_count``).
        - On the final attempt the payload and failure reason are sent to
          the dead-letter queue, output blobs are cleaned up, then the
          original message is deleted.
        - If the dead-letter send itself fails, the original message is

        """Stop a specific worker by cancelling its ``asyncio.Task``.

        Prefer ``stop_process(process_id)`` for a clean per-job teardown.
        Use this method only when you need to remove an entire worker loop
        (e.g. to scale down the number of concurrent workers at runtime).

        Behaviour:
        1. Cancels the worker's ``asyncio.Task`` and waits up to
           ``timeout_seconds`` for it to exit.
        2. Removes all tracking state for that worker (inflight message,
           batch id, job task, active-workers set).

        Caveat:
            If the worker is mid-message, the queue message is **not**
            explicitly deleted — it will become visible again after the
            visibility timeout expires and will be re-processed by another
            worker.

        Args:
            worker_id: Integer id assigned when the worker was spawned.
            timeout_seconds: Maximum time to wait for the task to
                acknowledge cancellation.

        Returns:
            ``True`` if the worker existed and was cancelled, ``False`` if
            no task was found for the given ``worker_id``.

           message is immediately dead-lettered (``force_dead_letter=True``)

           and ``batch_id`` in the per-worker inflight dictionaries.
        3. **Renew visibility** — start ``_renew_visibility_loop`` as a
           concurrent task so that long-running jobs don't lose their lease.
        4. **Execute** — resolve ``ClaimProcessor`` from the DI container
           (``app_context.get_service``) and call ``claim_processor.run()``.
        5. **Finalise**:
           - On success: ``_handle_successful_processing`` deletes the message.
           - On failure: ``_handle_failed_no_retry`` either schedules a
             retry or dead-letters the message.

           per-worker tracking dictionaries in a ``finally`` block.
